## 1. System Architecture Diagram  
Insert your system architecture diagram screenshot below:

## 2. Operating System Choice  

I picked **Ubuntu OS** over other operating systems such as **Fedora** and **Debian** due to its balance between stability and beginner friendliness.  
<br>

To show how I compared the systems, I created the table below.  
<br>

### Comparison Table  

| **Criteria**        | **Ubuntu**                                               | **Fedora**                                     | **Debian**                                   | **Reason for using Ubuntu**                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stability**       | Very stable, with LTS releases supported for 5 years.    | Stable, but releases only supported for 13 months. | Extremely stable, slower updates.            | Ubuntu gives stability over a longer time.                   |
| **Package Management** | Uses apt                                                | Uses dnf                                       | Uses apt                                      | apt is more widely known, making it easier to maintain.      |
| **Security Updates** | Has regular security patches                              | Quick updates but frequent version changes      | Reliable, but patches are released more slowly | Ubuntu’s automatic security updates make maintenance simple. |
| **Software Support** | Wide range of third-party and enterprise software support | Compatibility issues that limit Fedora overall  | Excellent but requires more manual setup      | Ubuntu supports a wide range of server and enterprise tools. |

## 3. VM Configuration Screenshot & Explanation  

Below is a screenshot of my **Ubuntu VM configuration**.  
This configuration balances performance, compatibility, and host resource usage:  

- **4GB RAM** → enough for smooth Ubuntu performance without slowing the host  
- **Shared network mode** → easy internet access for updates, installations, and testing

## 5. System Specification Commands (CLI)  

I used the terminal to document system specifications using commands such as:  

```bash
uname
free
df -h
ip addr
````

Below is the screenshot showing the outputs of these commands.
