I picked Ubuntu OS over other operating systems, such as Fedora and Debian, due to its balance between being stable and being more beginner friendly. I’ll add a table to show the main points of comparison made for me to think about this. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

| **Criteria**        | **Ubuntu**                                               | **Fedora**                                     | **Debian**                                   | **Reason for using Ubuntu**                                 |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stability**       | Very stable, with LTS releases supported for 5 years.    | Stable, but releases only supported for 13 months. | Extremely stable, slower updates.            | Ubuntu gives stability over a longer time.                   |
| **Package Management** | Uses apt                                                | Uses dnf                                       | Uses apt                                      | apt is more widely known, making it easier to maintain.      |
| **Security Updates** | Has regular security patches                              | Quick updates but frequent version changes      | Reliable, but patches are released more slowly | Ubuntu’s automatic security updates make maintenance simple. |
| **Software Support** | Wide range of third-party and enterprise software support | Compatibility issues that limit Fedora overall | Excellent but requires more manual setup      | Ubuntu supports a wide range of server and enterprise tools. |


 

 

 

Below is a screenshot of my Ubuntu VM configurations. The reason it is set that way is to balance performance as well as compatibility and resource efficiency. Allocating 4GB of RAM allows Ubuntu to run without any issues without impacting the host system. The shared network mode provides easy internet access, which is essential for software installation, system updates, and testing.

Here is a screenshot of the network configuration, which also shows my IP address when using the Ubuntu operating system.

I used a CLI, document system specifications. For example ‘uname’, ‘free’, ‘df -h’, ‘ip addr’. I have attached a screenshot of the results when using these specifications in the Ubuntu terminal.
